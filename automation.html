  <h1>Why test automation</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>it is the automation of software testing processes that are repetitive or where large amounts of data are handled. These automations are carried out with tools such as Selenium or Stela that are used to control and configure the conditions of the tests, the execution of the tests and the comparison of the results obtained with those expected. In this way, it is avoided that a person has to intervene and the processes are more autonomous and efficient.</p>
    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>
      Reduces time: once the tests are created, they can be run as many times as necessary at any time every day without requiring a complete team to run the tests manually.
It allows cross browsing testing: Having to test the same software in different browsers, operating systems and platforms manually involves a lot of work, but with process automation it can be done quickly even with the same lines of code.
Long-term cost reduction: While the implementation of automated software testing requires a lot of work up front, its long-term use greatly reduces the cost of the software.
They create consistency in tests: As certain tests are already defined and configured, they can be applied to different software with the same patterns and avoiding possible errors when implementing them.
    </p>
    <h2>When do it and when not to</h2>
    <p>
      <h3>It is advisable to do it when:</h3>
tests that need to be run multiple times or are repetitive
When they focus on risk areas of the application
Run with different data packages or with a large volume of data
critical system paths
Features that exhibit a high degree of error during manual testing
tests that run on different platforms, browsers, or operating systems.
<h3>It is better not to do it when:</h3>
results or data are not predictable as with CAPCHA tests, code reading and performance tests.
functionalities are unstable, for example when they have not been completed or are subject to change.
Time and resources are insufficient, as at the beginning automation can become a costly process, it must be determined that the necessary resources are available and can be maintained
</p>
<h2>Types of test</h2>
<p>
  <h3>Functional testing</h3>
This type of tests analyze and verify the behavior of already established functions, they are carried out with the objective of the correct operation of the application and that it complies with the requirements established by the client.
Some of these tests can be:
exploratory, spontaneous tests without spending a lot of time preparing or explaining them.
regression, to avoid ripple effects and unwanted behaviors.
environment compatibility, to check its functionality in different environments.
smoke, which are rapid and general tests.

<h3>Non-functional tests</h3>
The objective of these tests are the behaviors and important aspects that are not related to the functions that it performs, criteria by which system behaviors can be judged.
Its types of tests are:
load and performance tests, which verify behavior with increases in requests, queries and accesses.
recovery test, checks the recovery of systems and data in the event of a failure.
test installation, related to the deployment and installation of the product.
configuration tests, to verify behavior against software and hardware configurations.
